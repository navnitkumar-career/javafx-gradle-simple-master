## JavaFX Gradle Application [![JetBrains team project](http://jb.gg/badges/team.svg)](https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/ALL/JetBrains+on+GitHub)

A simple JavaFX application based off the [OpenJFX getting started documentation](https://openjfx.io/openjfx-docs/) that uses Gradle as the build system.

The project was created using the standard IntelliJ IDEA project wizard for creating Gradle projects.

This uses the [JavaFX Gradle plugin](https://github.com/openjfx/javafx-gradle-plugin) and Gradle 6.8. 

This application can be run from the command line:

    ./gradlew clean run

and via calling that task from the IntelliJ IDEA Gradle window.

It does NOT run if you run application class itself in IntelliJ IDEA.
